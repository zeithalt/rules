## 10. Sieging Capitals

`üìë Battle Rules`

In all battles where **a faction capital land** is attacked, it gets **double initial bonus points**. 

This double points rule is in favor of original capital owner:
- If DC attacks MT capital - MT gets double bonus;
- If DC holds MT capital, and Minds try to take it back - MT gets double bonus.

Double bonus rule **does** apply to [units](https://zeithalt.github.io/rules/#rules_06_map_units) and [adjacency points](https://zeithalt.github.io/rules/#rules_02_initial_bonus_points), but **does not** apply to [artefacts](https://zeithalt.github.io/rules/#rules_13_corrupted_artefacts).

If attack on a capital is successful, the winner has choice to make:

- Burn and loot the city.

    In this case the capital is destroyed, meaning no double bonus for original owner if they want to recapture, but they can establish a new capital in their remaining lands.

- Keep the city.

    In this case, the attacker keeps the city, but the original owner will get double bonus when they attempt to recapture it.

Using all possible bonuses for own capital defense can result in a battle starting where defender is already halfway there to the goal.  

For this reason capital sieges are rare and usually happen only when the attacker is confident in their victory.
