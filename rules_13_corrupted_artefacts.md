## 13. Corrupted Artefacts

`üìë Battle Rules`

After each *[Corrupted Battle](https://zeithalt.github.io/rules/#rules_09_corruption)* factions are able to gather residue *Corrupted Matter* and use it to build powerful artefacts.

Each faction gets **1 sample** if factions win together. However, if factions lose, only the faction attacked directly by Corruption gets a sample.

To complete the research and create an artefact, faction needs to collect **2 samples**.

***Corrupted artefacts***

These artefacts can be acquired via *Corrupted Research*:

**Corrupted Shards** - can be used by the attacking faction. Adds points to their initial attack bonus. This is a single use artefact.

**Corrupted Mines** - can be deployed on any lands the faction owns at the moment. If that land is attacked, **Mines** add to the faction's initial defense bonus. This is a single use artefact.

Bonuses from artefacts are **not** doubled in the [capital sieges](https://zeithalt.github.io/rules/#rules_10_sieging_capitals).

**Mines** do **not** have to be deployed immediately, faction can hold the mines without deploying them for as long as needed. Once deployed, mines cannot be moved.

The use of artifacts is not visible to other faction until the battle actually starts and [initial bonuses](https://zeithalt.github.io/rules/#rules_02_initial_bonus_points) are applied.

> To deploy the **Mines** or **Shards** you should use **/faction_action** command, for more info about these items please use **/faction_action_help**.
